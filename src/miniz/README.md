I detest the idea of copy-pasting someone's code into my repo and committing it. I would much rather have a system dependency or a submodule, so that versions are easily manageable and there's no possible room for confusion about who owns what. But when you make a build system as dysfunctional as miniz's, you leave me with no choice.
